This is a reference implementation of the hardware abstraction layer (https://github.com/olikraus/ucglib/wiki/hal), that uses http://wiringpi.com/ for I/O operations.

It should work on all Raspberry Pi versions supported by the WiringPi library. Just make sure to set the required values for the defines WIRING_PI_PIN_* at the top of the example. Beware that pin numbering for WiringPi can be confusing, check its documentation for details.
